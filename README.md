# G-A Overview Pack
### Overview Pack for EVE Online

The G-A Overview was created to provide a generalized, user-friendly overview, ready to use as it is, with a solution to be adapted as required.

This project started with the desire to have a corporate display, for the different operations, and not to have any problem of targeting during the activities in fleet.

- Choice of Full-Size or Compact 8-Tab Layouts that can be swapped at any time without reloading the entire pack.
- Modular Setup: Load the Preset Packs you need.
- Evolving presets for all activities on EVE, including dedicated Faction Warfare and Incursion presets among others.
- Color-coded presets by category for improved ease of selection.

## How to install
#### Must Read!

- Be sure to have a quick read of **[EVE University's Overview guide](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview)**, either to learn how everything works or have a reminder.


- We expect the **player to have a minimal understanding on how the Overview System works** before attempting to install G-A and/or any other 3rd party Overview Pack.

#### Method 1: In-game, from `G-A Overview` chat channel

1. Open up your Overview Settings ( ≡ button at top left of the Overview window).  
![Step 1](Images/Step_1a.png "Step 1")

2. Go to the "Misc" tab and click `Reset All Overview Settings`  
![Step 2](Images/Step_1b.png "Step 2")  
    - You **MUST** do this the first time you install.
    - This prevents any weirdness that may be caused by any changes already made to the overview.

3. Apply the `G-A Core` preset pack FIRST by clicking on its link.  
This is the only **required** preset pack.  
When combined with a Tab Layout, it includes the following presets for a minimal setup:
    - Core Presets  
    ![Core](Images/G-A_Core.png "Core Presets")  
    - **Navigation**, **Warpout** & **Brackets** presets
    - **Friendly Fleet**
    - **D-Scan: All**
    - **Drones: Ennemy & Friendly**

4. (Optional) Apply any of the following Optional preset packs by clicking on their links.  
You may need them for more specialized presets:
    - `G-A PvE Advanced Preset` contains presets for Anoms/Ratting, Incursion, Missions, and Mining.
    - `G-A PvP Advanced Preset` contains presets for Faction Warfare,Exploration, Ships Only, Deployables, Structures, and Wartargets.
    - `G-A PvP Extended Preset` packs include Target presets for specific categories, from Fighters to Frigates to Logi to Titans. Each pack contains half the categories and should be installed together.
    - `G-A Friendly Extended Preset` includes presets for Capitals, Supercapitals, Carriers, Dictors, Dreads, Logi, and Recon.
    - `G-A D-Scan Extended Preset` contains more finely-tuned presets specifically for the D-Scan filter.
    - _You can go back to add in additional packs at any time without reloading the entire pack. Simply click on a pack to add, then repeat step 5 below._
    - Note the instructions on the tab.   
    
    ![Basic Overview](Images/Basic_Overview.png "G-A Core + 1 Layout")
    
    ![Advanced Overview](Images/Advanced_Overview.png "G-A Core + Advanced Preset + 1 Layout")  ![Extended Overview](Images/Extended_Overview.png "G-A Core + All Preset + 1 Layout")  

5. To finish and set up the tabs, apply a Tab Layout by clicking on their links.  
Standard has each tab named for a purpose, and Compact replaces most of the names with numbers or shorter names for reduced tab width.  
2BL denotes 2 Bracket Lines, while 1BL denotes 1 Bracket Line.
 - `Standard` tab layout  
 ![Standard Tabs](Images/Standard_Tabs_Layout.png "Standard")  
 - `Compact` tab layout  
 ![Compact Tabs](Images/Compact_Tabs_Layout.png "Compact")  
 - `1BL` Brackets  
 ![1 Bracket Line](Images/1BL_Bracket.png "1BL") 
 - `2BL` Brackets  
 ![2 Bracket Lines](Images/2BL_Bracket.png "2BL")   
    - You can alternate between Layouts at any time without reloading the entire pack by clicking on their links.
    - _Some features might not show correctly at first, it may be necessary to open the Overview Settings again, then select the Ships tab to reload the UI to force a resync and apply all changes._

2. Once downloaded in the folder of your preference, extract the .zip file contents in a folder of your preference.

3. Go to the most recent version folder and:
    - Copy the `G-A Full Stylized.yaml` file for the complete pre-stylized overview.
    - Or copy the `G-A Full Unstylized.yaml` file for the complete default-style overview.
    - Or copy the specific packs you want/need, alongside one or all layouts.

4. Go to `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\EVE\Overview` folder and paste the copied files there.
    - If the folder doesn't exist, you can either create it manually.
    - Or export your current overview (recommended) and it will be created automatically.
        - To export, follow step 5-6.
        - Instead of import, choose export and mark `Check All`
        - This will save your current overview and its settings.

6. Go to the `Misc` tab:
    - Click `Reset All` to have the default settings loaded.
